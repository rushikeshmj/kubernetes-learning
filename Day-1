Why Kubernetes

Why we are not using docker in production environment.
Because docker is not supporting below features
1. It uses single host - docker host relies on single host only.
2. Autohealing - If one the container is dieing then we have to manually up the the container.
3. Autoscaling - If load increases on server then autoscaling of conatiner will not happen in docker we have to manually scale up the conatiner.
4. Simple platform - It has only enterprise level support.

For resolving above above problem in production environment we are using kubernetes.
