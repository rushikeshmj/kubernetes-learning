Kubernetes Architecture

1. Worker Node components

a. Container runtime - responsible for running your containers on worker node
b. Kubelet -
   - kubelet is an agent that runs on each worker node
   - creation of pod 
   - If pod fails it will take neccessary action
   - communicates with API server
c. Kube-proxy - 
   - networking purpose
   - manages network routing and load balancing for services
   - maintains network rules on nodes to ensure that traffic is correctly routed to the appropriate pods
d. Pods - Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes and can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace

2. Master Node (Control Plane) components
a. API server
   - It processes API requests, validates them, and updates the corresponding objects in etcd
   - All communication with the cluster is done via the API server
b. Scheduler (kube-scheduler)
   - scheduling your pod or resources in balanced manner across the cluster.
c. etcd 
   - etcd is a distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data, including the state of all objects in the cluster
d. Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)
   - The controller manager runs controllers, which are responsible for ensuring the desired state of the cluster
   - Common controllers include the replication controller, deployment controller, and node controller. 
   - They watch the API server for changes and make necessary adjustments to bring the cluster to the desired state.
